# Draft Review

## Question:  What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?

The question seems to be how robutst are Erdos and Renyi (ER) and Watts and Strogatz (WS) graphs under different types of attacks. I infered that this is the quetion as it was the one that the abstract seemed to answer, but it might have been clearer for it to have been stated in a thesis statement. Also, the first paragraph was unclear if we were trying to decide which type of model would be a good model for behavior the physical systems described when thery were under attack or if we were trying to decide what model we should make the physical systems resemble so that they would be attack resistant. 

## Methodology: Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?

The methodology is not descirbed in depth but is pretty simple. What is there makes perfect sense to answer the experimental question, although I am left wondering about the parts of the expereimental procedure which are left out. For example, how big(i.e how many nodes and how many edges) was each graph. How many simulations were done to ascertain the results. Overall I understood what the experiment did, but I could not replicate it from the instructions given.

## Results: 
Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?

I mostly understand their results although I am confused as to what "E" and "SF" refer to as the experement talks about "ER" and "WS" graphs only. I think that my confusion is mostly caused by the confusing design of the visuals of the original paper. The visual that were made by the team were much clearer. 

## Interpretation: 
Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?
I think that there interpretation of the visual was good. There were some points that they made (such as the limitations of Figure 1 and 2) which were not supported by any results presented, however. 

## Replication: 
Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper?  If so, how did the authors demonstrate that consistency?  Is it quantitative or qualitative?
From their interpreation of their work I would say that they did a good job replicating the original paper. They note that they get a different average path length by about a factor of ten, which would make sense if they had choosen different n (number of nodes) or k (average degree of nodes) value from the original paper and does not invalidate their replication. However, I could only base the success of their replication on their own analysis as I could not accurately understand interpret the visuals from the original paper. (Maybe including more explaination from the original paper might clarify the visuals.)

## Extension: 
Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Can it answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?
The report explains the extension to the original report clearly (adding in removal of random edges along with removal of random nodes.) I am curious under what situations we would expect a physical system to lose both nodes and edges. 

## Progress: 
Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?

This team seems well ahead of the game. They seem to be in the polishing stages of writing their report. 

## Presentation: 
Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guide?

This report was a draft and was written before we went over the style guide and so didn't follow it very closely, so in the interest of brevity I will use the points on the style guide as unit tests


1) Since the dawn of time, college students have been writing introductions that are too grandiose (and often false).  Just get into it; you don't have to make stuff up.  Write the abstract last and summarize the most important result = PASSED

2) The passive voice is a hoax. Please write in the first person (singular or plural).  Find an authorial voice that is casual enough to be engaging (without overdoing it) = PASSED -> I did not notice any use of it anyway

3) Write in the present tense when possible.  Even when you refer to results from previous work, it should usually be present tense: "Using data from BRFSS, they plot weight versus height and find that tall respondents are heavier, on average, than shorter respondents.  Our results are consistent with this conclusion." = FAILED -> Used the future tense, probably a holdover from the project proposal

4) When you edit, try to remove words. = FAILED? -> abstract could be shorter

5) Don't use the word "interesting."  Don't use "very", "quite", or other qualifiers.  Use "relatively" if one thing is actually relative to another, and it's clear what it's relative to.  Do not use "relatively" as a synonym for "kind of".  And don't use "kind of." FAILED -> Used all of these

6) Avoid using "significant" unless you mean "statistically significant;" a good alternative is "substantial."  Avoid using "correlation" unless you mean a coefficient of correlation.  In general, there might be a "relationship" between variables and you might characterize it with a correlation.  "Trend" usually means something is changing in time; "pattern" is more general. FAILED -> used significantly 

7) Imagine that you are writing for an audience that is not in your class.  Anticipate their questions and answer them.  If you are responding to questions I provided, do not include the questions in your text.  Rather, answer the questions in a logical order. PASSED -> Seems to be written for a techinical general audience

8) Explain your motivation.  Avoid "We were interested" and "We wanted" as pseudo-motivation.  And don't look at the camera; that is, don't use "because we were told to" as motivation, and avoid "for this project". FAILED -> I wish that it had started with a motivation section explaining why resilience in the design of the physical systems would be important (I know that the importance of road and electrical lines should be self evident but a motivation section would be nice nonetheless.) I think that a motivation section would make the audience of the piece better connect with the material and care about the experiment.

9) The logical flow should start with a question, which leads to a methodology, results, and an interpretation of the results as an answer to the question.  It should not be a narrative description of the process you went through.  Generally, don't report false starts, trials and tribulations.  Very occasionally there is something useful to report from a misstep, but usually no one cares. = FAILED, PASSED, PASSED, PASSED -> Just missing a statement of a question.

10) Figures should have labels on the axes and (usually) a title and a legend.  Formal figures have a number and a caption, and they can float.  Informal figures are part of the text flow. If a figure doesn't contain much information, remove it and summarize the results in text.  When you refer to figures and tables, capitalize "Figure" and "Table." = Passed -> Beautiful Graphs

11) All numbers should have an appropriate number of significant digits, which is usually less than you think, and never 16. = PASSED

12) Use a spellchecker. = FAILED -> There are a couple of typos in the report, such as "grapHoweverhs", but is otherwise well written. 

## Mechanics: 
Is the report in the right directory with the right file name?  Is it formatted professionally in Markdown?  Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors?  Is the bibliography in an acceptable style? 

The report is mechanically all correct.
