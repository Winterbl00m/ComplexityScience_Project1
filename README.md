## When The Strongest Survive in n-Person Duels
Neel Dhulipala and Hazel Smith

### Overview of Project
Game theory has long been used to explain behaviors found in fields like evolutionary biology and sociology to show why sometimes counterintuitive behaviors, like altruism, exist. However, sometimes game theory predicts actions which we do not observe in the real world. This paper is about one such paradox: the “survival of the weakest” in truels. (A truel is a three-player duel in which three players with different marksmanship take turns trying to eliminate each other until only one player remains.) Truels are useful models to model and actual physical confrontation or to model more abstract battles, like opinion spreading [2.] In “Truels, or survival of the weakest. Computing in Science & Engineering,”  Amengual et al. show that, if all players follow an optimal strategy, the player with the median marksmanship (not the strongest or weakest) is most likely to win. This raises the question of why do we see weaker players winning on the micro-scale (single truels) but strongest (fittest) players winning on the macro-scale (evolution). Wegener and Mutlu seem to find a solution to this paradox in their paper “The good, the bad, the well-connected” where they show that the strongest player does win if the truels take place in a scale-free network. In this paper, we attempt to replicate the Wegener and Mutlu model, but instead only find results that support the results found from traditional game theory.

### How to Run
In the code file of this repository there is hunger_games.py and hunger_games.ipynb. Both are the same code, just put in different formats for user convience. Running either should reproduce our model
